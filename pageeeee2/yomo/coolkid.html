<h1>My First CSS Example</h1>
<p><h2>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
     Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
     printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
      not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
      unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem 
      Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
      versions of Lorem Ipsum</h2></p>
